# Comp206

Welcome to Comp206 - Principles of imperative computation - which deals with 
the construction and study of "stateful" programs. So far, much of computing
history has been occupied by this form of programming, so understanding its
principles is useful and important for "real world" applications.

This course will be based on the course with the same title at 
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/CMU/ (Links to an external site.) . You can use
the course site at CMU as a reference point since much of what we're going to
cover, as well as the tools we're going to use are derived from that course.
We'll be using the language "C0" ("c-zero") during the initial part of the
course and then we'll switch over to plain C (the C99 standard C).

While the CMU course serves as the basis, I'll be adapting it a bit to suit our 
needs and timing. We will not be able to cover all of the material, but will
cover significant concepts, data structures, algorithms and methods. I'll also
be reordering some of the material and supplementing it for instructional needs
as I see fit.

I'm also provisioning a server for you so you can connect to it and use the 
"cc0" compiler and "coin" interpreter for the "c-zero" language. Some parts
of the documentation which talk about the "comp206 server" refer to this
server. It is a Linux environment, and you'll be expected to get familiar 
with the basics of manipulating files and running commands to be productive 
in it. You're also welcome to install the compiler (get it from here - 
https://bitbucket.org/c0-lang/docs/wiki/Downloads (Links to an external 
site.)) on your own laptops/desktops.

You can download the course notes as a single PDF from the [releases][] page.
