Instructions
============

1. Each question appears in a separate file named "qn.c0" where n 
   is the question number. There are 3 questions totaling 25 points.

2. The question appears as a comment at the top of the file.
   The rest of the file has placeholder functions for you
   to fill. 

3. The files are expected to be compilable using the command
   "make" run within the directory containing the source files.
   Running the "make" command will produce an executable file
   named "program" which you can run using "./program".
   The "main" function in main.c is given empty. You can fill it
   with any tests for the functions you need to write.
   Whenever you change any source file and you wish to run it
   to test it out, you can run "make" to produce the program
   and run it. As a shorthand, you can also type "make run".
   Once your work is complete and you want to submit, run
   "make submission" and a file named "midterm.tar.gz" will
   be generated in the parent directory. You can submit that
   file. Do not modify the Makefile.

4. You may use the provided main.c for your tests. This file
   is not part of the submission. You may do whatever you want
   within this. By default it calls the test functions declared
   in each module.

6. DO NOT modify the file names of the questions.

7. DO NOT modify the names of the functions you're expected to fill out.
   You'll need to put in your code wherever you see a "// TODO:" marker.
   You're also required to write the loop invariants for loops that you
   create .. even if only trivial ones exist. If you have test functions 
   that check properties that are typically checked by contracts, they may
   count towards your score in lieu of contracts, but stick to
   the given function stubs for basic contracts.

8. Any additional functions you add that are used by your code are ok.
   Most of the necessary #include declarations are already made for you.
   You shouldn't need any additional ones. If you need, please add.

9. Normal plagiarism checks apply.

10. Please use appropriate indentation to make your code readable.

11. Do place explanatory comments where you see necessary.
