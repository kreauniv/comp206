Welcome

Welcome to Comp206 - Principles of imperative computation - which deals with
the construction and study of "stateful" programs. So far, much of computing
history has been occupied by this form of programming, so understanding its
principles is useful and important for "real world" applications.

This course will be based on the course with the same title at
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/CMU/ (Links to an external site.) . You can use
the course site at CMU as a reference point since much of what we're going to
cover, as well as the tools we're going to use are derived from that course.
We'll be using the language "C0" ("c-zero") during the initial part of the
course and then we'll switch over to plain C (the C99 standard C).

While the CMU course serves as the basis, I'll be adapting it a bit to suit our
needs and timing. We will not be able to cover all of the material, but will
cover significant concepts, data structures, algorithms and methods. I'll also
be reordering some of the material and supplementing it for instructional needs
as I see fit.
